                        <li>Life satisfaction is a concern. You should be aware that low life satisfaction more than doubles the risk of chronic disease and early death. Life satisfaction is strongly associated with sleep problems, pain, obesity, smoking, anxiety, physical activity, diagnosed mental disease, and with higher healthcare utilization and costs. People who are dissatisfied with some aspects of their lives may need to pay special attention to finding activities that bring joy, purpose, meaning to your life.</li>

Loneliness is worse for health than smoking 15 cigarettes a day or being obese â€“ it is associated with higher risk of stress, anxiety; depression; heart disease; stroke; dementia; falls; use of long-term care; and early death. People who are lonely need to find positive ways to connect with others in ways that are authentic and satisfying. </li>
